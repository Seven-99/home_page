 <section class="history_section">
    <p class="about_txt">Throughout my short life, I’ve met many people—some I thought were cool, funny, and worth calling friends. I even considered many of them best friends. But as time passed, I realized I didn’t understand much about life back then. People disappeared like dust in the wind, and eventually, I found myself alone.

In that solitude, I began to reflect on what bonds us—on how people truly connect.

It was 2018, my final year of high school, when I met this skinny guy. He was cracking terrible jokes—so bad I silently wished someone would just hush him. That Friday, a group of classmates invited me to a bar, and he happened to be there. We started talking—just small stuff about school—but something clicked. Days passed, and we kept talking. Slowly, we began sharing more and more, discovering how much we had in common.

In February 2019, we were joking around about a girl we both liked. She was a firefighter, and we made a bet to impress her—we decided to enroll in the fire academy. The course lasted about a year and a half. It was tough, but it was worth every second. We grew so close that when we were out on a call, we could communicate without even speaking. We just knew.

Tomi wasn’t just a good firefighter—he was an extraordinary human being. He had knowledge, discipline, and skill, but also empathy, patience, wisdom, and natural leadership. We were Bravos 26 and 27. His charisma lit up every room. His devotion and energy were contagious. People felt better just being around him.

In February 2024, I got the news—Tomi was in the hospital, preparing for brain surgery after suffering an aneurysm. The doctors were hopeful… they said he would recover. But he didn’t.

The last time I saw him was in a plaza. We shared a soda and talked about a show we planned to watch together. I never imagined it would be our final conversation.

To me, he was more than a friend. He was a brother, a partner, my best duo. I miss you with all my heart and soul, brother.

You’ll always be with me.

        <q class="bible_quote">
            There is a time for everything,
            and a season for every activity under the heavens:
            a time to be born and a time to die,
            a time to plant and a time to uproot,
            a time to kill and a time to heal,
            a time to tear down and a time to build,
            a time to weep and a time to laugh,
            a time to mourn and a time to dance,
            a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,
            a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,
            a time to search and a time to give up,
            a time to keep and a time to throw away,
            a time to tear and a time to mend,
            a time to be silent and a time to speak,
            a time to love and a time to hate,
            a time for war and a time for peace.
