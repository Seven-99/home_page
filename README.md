This project is part of my journey through The Odin Project, where I’m learning web development step by step. While I followed the general structure and styling guidelines (fonts and colors) from the project brief, I decided to create something more personal and meaningful.

About the Project.

This is a tribute page dedicated to my best friend and fallen firefighter comrade, Tomas Valentin Gigena, also known as el Flaco. He was a kind, wise, and unforgettable soul whose presence always brought light and strength to those around him.
Instead of just completing another coding assignment, I chose to tell a real story—one that means a lot to me. Every section, color, and word on this page was carefully chosen to honor his memory and the impact he had on my life.
